i3lock - improved screen locker
===============================
i3lock is a simple screen locker like slock. After starting it, you will
see a white screen (you can configure the color/an image). You can return
to your screen by entering your password.

Many little improvements have been made to i3lock over time:

- i3lock forks, so you can combine it with an alias to suspend to RAM
  (run "i3lock && echo mem > /sys/power/state" to get a locked screen
   after waking up your computer from suspend to RAM)

- You can specify either a background color or a PNG image which will be
  displayed while your screen is locked.

- You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.

- i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP etc.
  On OpenBSD i3lock uses the bsd_auth(3) framework.

Differences of this fork from upstream
--------------------------------------

- Cool clock on the lockscreen `-T` flag
- No autoshit

Requirements
------------

Look into [`travis/Dockerfile`](travis/Dockerfile) for a list of
`apt install`'able dependencies.

Running i3lock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'i3lock' command. To get out of it, enter your password and
press enter.

On OpenBSD the `i3lock` binary needs to be setgid `auth` to call the
authentication helpers, e.g. `/usr/libexec/auth/login_passwd`.
